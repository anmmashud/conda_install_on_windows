# Installing Jupyter Notebook on Windows

This guide provides simple and effective instructions for installing Jupyter Notebook on a Windows system using Python. It also includes solutions for common issues you might face during the installation process.

## Prerequisites

- **Python Installed**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading and installing packages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook

1. Open your Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install jupyter
   ```

   This command uses `pip` (Python's package installer) to download and install Jupyter Notebook.

### Step 2: Resolve Installation Issues (If Any)

You might encounter some common issues during or after installation. Here are the problems and their solutions:

1. **Theme Errors or Conflicting Packages**:
   - If you see an error like:

     ```
     AttributeError: module 'notebook.services.contents.filemanager' has no attribute 'themes'
     ```

     Or face other theme-related or package conflicts, follow these steps:

     1. Uninstall all Jupyter-related packages by running:

        ```bash
        pip uninstall jupyter jupyterlab notebook nbconvert nbformat
        ```

     2. Clear the pip cache to remove residual files:

        ```bash
        pip cache purge
        ```

     3. Reinstall Jupyter Notebook:

        ```bash
        python -m pip install jupyter
        ```

     This ensures a clean installation by removing any conflicting or corrupted files.

2. **'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command**:
   - This error occurs when the Python Scripts folder is not in your system's PATH.
   - Solution:
     - Add the Python Scripts folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Scripts`) to your system's PATH environment variable.
     - Restart your Command Prompt after making the changes.

3. **Outdated pip Version**:
   - An outdated pip version can cause installation problems.
   - Solution:
     - Upgrade pip by running:

       ```bash
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       ```

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Missing dependencies can lead to incomplete installations.
   - Solution:
     - Install required dependencies with:

       ```bash
       python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
       ```

## Additional Notes

- Always ensure you are running the latest version of Python and pip.
- If issues persist, consider using a Python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for an easier setup process.
- For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.org/).

By following these steps, you will have Jupyter Notebook installed and ready to use on your Windows system. Happy coding!
