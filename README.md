   | **Includes Anaconda Navigator** | Yes                                                                      | No                                                                       |
   | **Number of Packages**  | Over 300                                                                 | Less than 70                                                              |

   **Recommendation**: If you prefer a ready-to-use environment with many packages included, choose **Anaconda**. If you prefer a lightweight installation and want to customize your environment by installing only the packages you need, choose **Miniconda**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

4. **Download the Installer**

   - Click on the appropriate installer for your system (e.g., Windows 64-bit).
   - The download will begin, and the installer file will be saved to your computer.

5. **Run the Installer**

   - Locate the downloaded installer file and double-click it to start the installation process.

6. **Choose Installation Type**

   - In the "Select Installation Type" window, you will see two options:
     - **Just Me (Recommended)**: Installs Anaconda for the current user account.
     - **All Users**: Installs Anaconda for all user accounts on the computer (requires Windows Administrator privileges).
   - It is recommended to select **Just Me** unless you have a specific need for the **All Users** option. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

7. **Select Destination Folder**

   - Choose a destination folder for the installation.
   - Ensure that the installation directory path does not contain spaces or Unicode characters. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

8. **Customize Installation Options**

   - In the "Advanced Installation Options" window, you will see several options:
     - **Create shortcuts**: Selected by default. Creates Start Menu shortcuts for Anaconda Navigator, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda Prompt. Deselecting this option skips creating these shortcuts.
     - **Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable**: Adds the path that contains the conda binaries to your PATH environment variable. Anaconda does not recommend selecting this option, as it can lead to conflicts with other software. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
     - **Register Anaconda3 as my default Python 3.12**: Registers the Python package in this install as the default Python for programs like VSCode, PyCharm, etc.
     - **Clear the package cache upon completion**: Runs `conda clean --all --force-pkgs-dirs` after the install finishes.
   - It is recommended to leave the default selections as they are unless you have specific requirements.

9. **Begin Installation**

   - Click **Install** to begin the installation process.
   - The installation might take a few minutes to complete.
   - Click **Show details** to view the packages being installed.

10. **Complete Installation**

    - Click **Next** twice, then click **Finish** to close the installer.
