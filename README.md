# Installing Jupyter Notebook or Anaconda on Windows

This guide provides simple and effective instructions for installing Jupyter Notebook on a Windows system using Python. Alternatively, for a better experience, you can install **Anaconda** or **Miniconda**, which come with Jupyter and additional tools pre-installed. It also includes solutions for common issues during the installation process.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python Installed**: Ensure Python is installed on your system if you plan to use Jupyter directly. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.

---

## Steps

### Option 1: Install Jupyter Notebook (If you only need Notebook)

1. Open your Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install jupyter
   ```

   This command uses `pip` (Python's package installer) to download and install Jupyter Notebook.

---

### Option 2: Install Anaconda or Miniconda (Recommended)

1. **Visit the Download Pages**:
   - [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
   - [Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. **Choose the Right Installer**:
   - Select the installer suitable for your system (e.g., Windows 64-bit).
   - If you’re unsure which to choose, refer to the table below for guidance.

   **Comparison Between Anaconda and Miniconda**:

   | Feature                | Anaconda                                                                 | Miniconda                                                                 |
   |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Includes conda**      | Yes                                                                      | Yes                                                                      |
   | **Includes Anaconda Navigator** | Yes                                                                      | No                                                                       |
   | **Number of Packages**  | Over 300                                                                 | Less than 70                                                              |
   | **Install Space Required** | Approximately 4.4 GB                                                     | Approximately 480 MB                                                     |

   **Recommendation**: 
   - Choose **Anaconda** for a ready-to-use environment with many pre-installed packages.
   - Choose **Miniconda** for a lightweight installation, adding only the packages you need.

3. **Run the Installer**:
   - After downloading the installer, double-click to run it.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions.

4. **Recommended Installation Options**:
   During the installation, you’ll see the following options:
   - **Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable**: Not recommended. 
   - **Register Anaconda as my default Python**: Recommended.
   - **Add shortcuts for Anaconda tools to Start Menu**: Recommended.

<summary><strong>Common Issues and Solutions</strong></summary>

1. **Theme Errors or Conflicting Packages**:
   - If you see an error like:

     ```
     AttributeError: module 'notebook.services.contents.filemanager' has no attribute 'themes'
     ```

     Or face other theme-related or package conflicts, follow these steps:

     1. Uninstall all Jupyter-related packages by running:

        ```bash
        pip uninstall jupyter jupyterlab notebook nbconvert nbformat
        ```

     2. Clear the pip cache to remove residual files:

        ```bash
        pip cache purge
        ```

     3. Reinstall Jupyter Notebook:

        ```bash
        python -m pip install jupyter
        ```

2. **'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command**:
   - This error occurs when the Python Scripts folder is not in your system's PATH.
   - Solution:
     - Add the Python Scripts folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Scripts`) to your system's PATH environment variable.
     - Restart your Command Prompt after making the changes.

3. **Outdated pip Version**:
   - An outdated pip version can cause installation problems.
   - Solution:
     - Upgrade pip by running:

       ```bash
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       ```

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Missing dependencies can lead to incomplete installations.
   - Solution:
     - Install required dependencies with:

       ```bash
       python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
       ```
